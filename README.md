RakshaRisk: AI-Powered Fraud Detection & Credit Default Prediction
Overview

RakshaRisk is an AI-powered platform designed to detect fraud and predict credit defaults with over 85% accuracy. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data, identify fraudulent activities, and assess the risk of credit defaults. It also integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability, ensuring transparency and providing real-time risk monitoring through interactive Power BI dashboards.

Features

Fraud Detection: AI-driven algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions and activities.

Credit Default Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of credit defaults based on user data.

Explainable AI with SHAP: Uses SHAP to provide interpretability for model predictions, ensuring transparency and building trust.

Real-time Monitoring: Interactive Power BI dashboards for real-time tracking of predictions and risk factors.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, SHAP

Machine Learning Algorithms: Supervised learning techniques (e.g., classification and regression models)

Visualization Tools: Power BI for interactive dashboards

Explainable AI: Integrated SHAP for model interpretability

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/raksha-risk.git


Navigate to the project directory:

cd raksha-risk


Install the necessary dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the main script to train the model:

python train_model.py


After training, use the prediction script to test the model:
