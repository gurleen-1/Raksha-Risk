# RakshaRisk: AI-Powered Fraud Detection & Credit Default Prediction

## Overview
**RakshaRisk** is an AI-powered platform designed to detect fraud and predict credit defaults with **85%+ accuracy**. The project applies machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data, identify fraudulent transactions, and assess the risk of credit defaults. It integrates **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability, ensuring transparency, and includes interactive **Power BI dashboards** for real-time risk monitoring.  

## Features
- **Fraud Detection**: Machine learning algorithms to identify suspicious or fraudulent transactions.  
- **Credit Default Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of credit defaults based on customer financial data.  
- **Explainable AI with SHAP**: Provides interpretability for model predictions to ensure transparency and trust.  
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Power BI dashboards for tracking predictions, KPIs, and risk factors in real time.  

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, SHAP  
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Supervised learning models (classification and regression)  
- **Visualization Tools**: Power BI for interactive dashboards  
- **Explainable AI**: SHAP for model interpretability
