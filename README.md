# RakshaRisk: AI-Powered Fraud Detection & Credit Default Prediction

## Overview

**RakshaRisk** is an AI-powered platform designed to detect fraud and predict credit defaults with over 85% accuracy. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data, identify fraudulent activities, and assess the risk of credit defaults. It also integrates **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability, ensuring transparency and providing real-time risk monitoring through interactive Power BI dashboards.

## Features

- **Fraud Detection**: AI-driven algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions and activities.
- **Credit Default Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of credit defaults based on user data.
- **Explainable AI with SHAP**: Uses SHAP to provide interpretability for model predictions, ensuring transparency and building trust.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Interactive Power BI dashboards for real-time tracking of predictions and risk factors.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - SHAP
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Supervised learning techniques (e.g., classification and regression models)
- **Visualization Tools**: Power BI for interactive dashboards
- **Explainable AI**: Integrated **SHAP** for model interpretability
