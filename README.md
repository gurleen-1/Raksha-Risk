# RakshaRisk: AI-Powered Fraud Detection & Credit Default Prediction

This project focuses on building a data-driven system for detecting financial fraud and predicting credit default risk using Python-based machine learning techniques.  
By analyzing transaction histories, customer profiles, and financial behaviors, the model identifies fraudulent patterns and estimates the likelihood of loan or credit default.

The purpose of this work is to demonstrate how predictive modeling and intelligent analytics can support financial institutions in strengthening risk management and decision-making processes.

## Project Overview

Fraud detection and credit default prediction are key challenges in the financial industry.  
RakshaRisk introduces a unified analytical framework that applies machine learning methods to identify fraudulent activity and assess customer credit risk.  
The system supports proactive fraud prevention and early detection of high-risk accounts through interpretable, data-driven insights.

## Objectives

- Detect fraudulent transactions using behavioral and statistical patterns.  
- Predict the probability of credit default based on customer and transactional data.  
- Quantify overall risk exposure for customers and transactions.  
- Provide interpretable outputs to support financial decision-making.  
- Demonstrate a scalable approach to risk prediction and fraud analysis.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Techniques:** Feature engineering, anomaly detection, supervised learning, ensemble modeling  
- **Data Sources:** Transactional records, credit profiles, repayment history  
- **Outputs:** Risk scores, fraud flags, model performance metrics, and visual analytics  

## Methodology

The system combines data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning to identify fraudulent activity and predict credit default.  
The workflow includes cleaning and normalizing data, engineering domain-specific features, and training classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
The models generate risk probabilities and fraud scores that can be visualized for interpretability and decision support.

## Key Steps

1. Load and preprocess financial and transactional datasets.  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to identify key indicators of risk.  
3. Engineer relevant features for fraud and credit default prediction.  
4. Train supervised and unsupervised learning models.  
5. Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision, and recall.  
6. Generate visualizations and reports summarizing model performance and insights.  
7. Save trained models and results for further evaluation or deployment.

## Recommendations

- Implement real-time data streaming for live fraud detection.  
- Incorporate explainable AI tools (e.g., SHAP, LIME) for transparent risk scoring.  
- Integrate with financial APIs for automated data updates.  
- Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask for user-friendly access.  
- Expand the system to support portfolio-level credit risk monitoring.

## Conclusion

RakshaRisk demonstrates how Python-based machine learning can be applied to financial risk analysis, combining fraud detection and credit default prediction within a single framework.  
It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, model interpretability, and predictive accuracy in financial analytics.  
While developed as a research-oriented system, RakshaRisk provides a strong foundation for real-world applications in fraud prevention and credit risk management.
